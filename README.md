# Heart-Disease-Prediction

The Problem Statement is to predict if an individual has heart disease on the basis of their data. The dataset is heart.csv. It has columns like age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, etc. It has 14 such columns and 304 rows.
I've used Logistic Regression since what I was looking for is binary.
